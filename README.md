# TASK DESCRIOTON:
 Project Title:
# Media Player App with Local Audio Playback and Basic Controls

ðŸ”¸ Description:
This project involves the development of a Media Player Android application that is capable of playing audio files stored in the deviceâ€™s local storage. The goal is to create a functional and user-friendly app that allows users to listen to music or audio files with basic playback controls.

The app scans the deviceâ€™s local storage to list available audio files (such as MP3, WAV, etc.). Users can browse and select a song to play. Once an audio file is selected, the media player begins playback and provides the user with simple and intuitive controls:

Play â€“ To start or resume the audio

Pause â€“ To temporarily stop the audio

Skip/Next â€“ To jump to the next audio file in the playlist

(Optionally, a Previous button can also be added)

The user interface displays:

The current playing audio title

Playback progress using a SeekBar

Elapsed time and total duration

The app uses the Android MediaPlayer API, which supports various audio formats and provides efficient handling of audio playback. The app is designed to run smoothly in the background, allowing users to continue listening even when they switch to another app.

The structure of the app ensures separation of concerns:

The UI layer is responsible for displaying songs and playback controls.

The MediaPlayer logic handles loading and controlling audio files.

Optional use of foreground service or notification controls can provide playback control when the app is minimized.

The app reads audio files using the MediaStore API or directly from local file paths. A RecyclerView is used to display the list of available audio files, making the interface easy to scroll and select songs.
